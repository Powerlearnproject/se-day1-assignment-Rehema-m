Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of building, designing, and testing a software.
it helps in developing reliable and user friendly softwares that meet the needs of the owner and users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
software engineering has simplified complex tasks
it has created a secure way to create your tasks
it has helped digitise many tasks that required alot of work 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning stage-the developers highlight what the projects objective is.
analysis stage -the developers gather the necessary requirements for the project.
design stage- the developers outline the details for the overall application.
develobment stage- the developers write the code and build the application according to the specifications.
testing stage- the developer checks for any bugs in the application they created.
implementation stage- the developers now intergrate the software into its environment.
maintenance stage- the developers ensures to solve any bugs that may arise after the software was implemented.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology it is Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on while the agile  methodology is Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
- developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer
 - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager
- assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. 
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Limited Infrastructure 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements  
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.
  - They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about space stuff."
Improved Prompt: "Provide a concise overview of the key milestones in human space exploration from 1961 to 2025."
the improved prompt is important because it specifies the topic (human space exploration), sets a clear time frame (1961 to 2025), and defines the desired output (a concise overview of key milestones).
